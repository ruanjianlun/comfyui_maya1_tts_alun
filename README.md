## 📦 Installation

### Method 1: Clone directly to ComfyUI custom nodes directory

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
git clone https://github.com/your-username/comfyui_alun_maya1.git
cd comfyui_alun_maya1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Copy the entire project folder to `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

Main dependencies include:
- `transformers` - Hugging Face model library
- `torch` - PyTorch deep learning framework
- `snac` - SNAC audio codec
- `soundfile` - Audio file processing
- `numpy` - Numerical computing

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Add Node in ComfyUI

1. Launch ComfyUI
2. Right-click on canvas, select `Add Node` -> `audio` -> `maya1` -> `Maya1 Text to Speech`
3. The node will appear on the canvas

### 2. Configure Node Parameters

The node provides the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| **text** | String | Text to convert to speech | "Hello, this is a test..." |
| **voice_preset** | Dropdown | Voice style preset | Male-Mature |
| **chunk_length** | Integer | Text chunk length (characters) | 50 |
| **temperature** | Float | Generation temperature (0.1-1.0, higher = more random) | 0.4 |
| **custom_description** | String (Optional) | Custom voice description | Empty |

### 3. Voice Style Presets

5 built-in voice style presets:

- **Male-Mature**: Male voice around 30 years old, American accent, normal pitch, warm timbre
- **Female-Gentle**: Female voice around 20 years old, American accent, slightly high pitch, soft timbre
- **Male-Energetic**: Male voice around 20 years old, American accent, high energy, bright timbre
- **Female-Professional**: Female voice around 30 years old, British accent, professional tone, clear timbre
- **Neutral-Broadcast**: Neutral voice, standard accent, clear articulation, balanced timbre

### 4. Custom Voice Description

If presets don't meet your needs, use the `custom_description` parameter for custom voice characteristics:

```
Realistic male voice in the 40s age with british accent. 
Deep pitch, authoritative tone, slow pacing.
```

Description template:
- **Age**: in the 20s/30s/40s age
- **Accent**: american/british/australian accent
- **Pitch**: high/normal/low/deep pitch
- **Timbre**: warm/bright/soft/clear timbre
- **Pacing**: fast/moderate/slow/conversational pacing
- **Style**: energetic/professional/gentle/authoritative tone

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Storage Location

Models will auto-download to:
```
ComfyUI/models/maya1_tts_alun/
```

Includes the following model files:
- Maya1 main model (~4GB)
- Maya1 tokenizer
- SNAC audio decoder (~200MB)

### Output File Location

Generated audio files are saved to:
```
ComfyUI/output/maya_tts_XXXXXX.wav
```

File naming format: `maya_tts_{timestamp}.wav`

### Audio Specifications

- **Sample Rate**: 24000 Hz
- **Format**: WAV (16-bit PCM)
- **Channels**: Mono

## 📊 Workflow Example

The project includes a basic workflow example `workflow_example.json`, demonstrating how to:

1. Use the Maya1 TTS node to generate speech
2. Save the generated audio file
3. Preview and play the audio

### Import Workflow

1. Open ComfyUI
2. Click the `Load` button
3. Select the `workflow_example.json` file
4. Click `Queue Prompt` to start generation

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### Modify Default Model Path

Edit the `get_maya_model_path()` function in `config.py`:

```python
def get_maya_model_path():
    # Custom model path
    return "/your/custom/path/to/models"
```

### Add New Voice Presets

Add to the `VOICE_PRESETS` dictionary in `config.py`:

```python
VOICE_PRESETS = {
    # ... existing presets
    "Custom-Preset-Name": "Your custom voice description here",
}
```

### Clear Model Cache

To free up VRAM, call:

```python
from config import clear_model_cache
clear_model_cache()
```

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Q1: First run is very slow?

**A**: First run requires downloading models (~4GB), please be patient. Models cache locally, subsequent usage will be much faster.

### Q2: Out of memory errors?

**A**: 
- Reduce the `chunk_length` parameter (e.g., change to 30)
- Close other VRAM-consuming programs
- Use CPU mode (auto-detects, no configuration needed)

### Q3: Generated speech quality is not ideal?

**A**:
- Adjust the `temperature` parameter (0.3-0.5 usually works well)
- Try different voice presets
- Use custom descriptions for more precise voice characteristics
- Ensure input text has correct grammar and punctuation

### Q4: Does it support Chinese?

**A**: Current version primarily supports English text-to-speech, Chinese support is limited. Recommended to use English text for best results.

### Q5: How to speed up generation?

**A**:
- Ensure using GPU (CUDA)
- Reduce `chunk_length` (but may affect speech continuity)
- Lower `temperature` value
- Process long text in segments
